# Solitaire

A clone of Microsoft Windows Solitaire (in VB.NET / .NET 8).

This version pays tribute to arguably the most played game... ever.

The project represents the *revisited* version; where it has been completely reworked, ported, improved and adjusted for compiling/running on .NET 8.

The simplest way to get started with the code is to use [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) (It's FREE!).

This work is inspired, in part, by the C# version that was originally made available on GotDotNet.  After working through to convert this code (circa 2004-2005) to VB.NET, fixing several bugs and adding missing features, it was published to [AddressOf.com](http://addressof.com/posts/solitaire-written-in-vb-net/).

The following information is taken from the original announcement.

Here's a quick list of some (original) improvements:

- Added XP Visual Styles support.
- Added persistent storage (code is capable of using Windows logo compliant storage or Isolated storage)
- Fixed: When less than three cards remaining on the left and then clicking to see them, some cards from below in the pile show through.
- Added context help on the dialogs and integration with the associated Windows help files (Not sure if this will work on Windows 98 or not).
- Added checking the minimum size to the main window.
- Added persisting location and size of the main window.

Since that time...

- Ported to .NET 8.
- Cleaned up all code to fit the more modern (evolved) coding style.
- Addressed issues reported in VS 2022.

Additionally, I'd like to give credit to the following for their work on the C# version that this is inspired: Christine Morin and Chris Sells.

Unfortunately, the original C# version may be lost to history after the closure of GotDotNet. :-(
